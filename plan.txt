What is the purpose?
To create a Reddit like site, but better.
Probably won't be able to get users
Build a reddit extension
Build something like the Chinese site Lydia told me about
Auto seed the site with content
From Reddit

Does something else have higher priority?
no

What is the first step?  second?
start building the site
look at what could be possible from a critter approach
repeat
maybe I'll decide critter is a bad idea
the steps for the site itself:
add a way to post articles
add a way to vote
including taco vote
provide personalized recommendations based on this info
oraculist? nah

How are you going to test this?
will use myself

How is this going to work in production?
just like reddit

How can we divide up the work?
i can do it

What are the input formats?
website, so clicks and stuff
links from reddit
user submitted content maybe later

What are the output formats?
a web page
selected links

Is this change going to break existing processes?
no existing process

Is there an easier way?  (avoid coding)
people login with their reddit account
their upvoted articles are pulled in
they mark their special favorites
not much easier

Is it worth it?
way to test critter possibilities
way to consume internet content

Can I adapt something that already exists?
kind of what i'm doing with critter
don't know what happened to tacovote

Do I have enough time to see it through to completion?
yeah
unless I end up working for Aidan

Can I preempt any blockers?
no blockers

Is there anyone I can ask for advice?
not that i can think of
should talk to tomalsky later

What are the risks?
nobody wants it
reddit shows people want contenet
nobody is willing to vote
should be pretty easy to do
requires users to power the personalized recs
could get users by stealing reddit content?
is that legal?
yeah it's just an aggregator

How can we track usage?
Add logging with timestamps

Make sure everyone knows what they are doing
just me

How are we going to integrate with other systems?
scrape reddit
figure out critter
no other systems

Are there concurrency issues?
two people vote at the same time?
seems pretty trivial to handle

How could this be done faster?
don't build critter
reddit is already open source
but very complicated
oh that's an old version

Do you know what all the terms mean?
yes

What are the edge cases?
lots of votes
no votes
nbd
divide by zero in personalized recs
hard drive fills up
nbd

Can you enable ops to drive the content?
no ops

Are any significant events coming up?
nope

Get design reviewed
no one to review

Is product ok with the plan?
no product

Create a diagram
always

Are we following the spec exactly?
no spec

Do I have a fast feedback loop?
yes

Is anyone else working on the same thing?
no

Is this legal?
yes
